## Abstract

" vistweet " is a application to visualize relations among tweets on Twitter.
First, you have to authorize Vital Atlas on Twitter and input the PIN code.
vistsweet reads and analyzes recent tweets when you click the reload button at the upper right (or every 5 minutes).
When you click the timeline at the left, a cluster consisting of your tweets and relational tweets (reply/RT) will be shown.
A red line and icon show "reply," the green shows " official retweet (RT), " and the blue shows "unofficial retweet (QT: quote tweet). "
You can change the scale by using plus/minus buttons at the upper right.
